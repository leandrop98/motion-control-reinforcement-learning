# Motion Control using Reinforcement Learning
![Q-Learning Result](https://github.com/leandrop98/motion-control-reinforcement-learning/blob/master/Q-Learning.gif?raw=true)

In this project was implemented three different reinforcement learning methods:
- Q-Learning
- SARSA
- Actor-Critic

The environment used was a simulated inverted pendulum. All the methods were implemented in MATLAB.
